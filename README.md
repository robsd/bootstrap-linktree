# bootstrap-linktree üîó

A simple page to put your links and socials with a built-in dark mode, made with Bootstrap.

## How to use

1. Fork this repo.
2. Replace `assets/images/avatar.png` with your own picture.
3. Edit the `index.html` file to update your name and links.
4. Follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) if you want to host it for free with GitHub Pages (you can even use a custom domain or subdomain like `links.yourname.com` or `socials.yourname.com`).

## Theming

- Either write your own CSS to override [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)'s default styles or use one of [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)'s themes.
- There is already a stylesheet in `assets/css/style.css` which contains some social icon brand colours.
